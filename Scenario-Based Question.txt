Scenario-Based Question
Riya is working as a Cloud Intern in an IT company. Her team leader has assigned her a task to manage cloud storage properly.

First, Riya needs to create a storage service and inside it, she must create a bucket.

After creating the bucket, she has to upload a file into that bucket with some sample data.

In the next step, Riya must enable versioning on the bucket so that multiple versions of the uploaded file can be maintained.
